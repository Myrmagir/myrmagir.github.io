After working on Myrmagir for almost a year now, we decided to share our pen and paer game with the world.
It mixes the genres fantasy, sci-fi and steampunk together into a hell of a solarsystem called Quinterra!

Yet, we are not finished with our first solar- and the whole gamesystem, which is why we will update this website with every blogpost a bit more!
We hope you readers will share your thoughts on our ideas with us and we will try to answer as much and fast as possible, but since we are a team of students we might not find time fast in some cases.

If you want to ask us anything which needs more place to write, just send us an email to myrmagir@googlemail.com.

We will begin to post on our blog in the midst of august!

Enough with the organisational stuff, this is our team (Haiku), with our synonyms:
