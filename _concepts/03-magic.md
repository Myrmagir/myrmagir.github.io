## Power of the Waves
### Two Kinds
There exist two kinds of magic in Myrmagir which are  
 - Internal or Elemental Magic and  
 - External or Free Magic  

The difference lies in the usage of the Astralwave, as it can either store elementals in itself or resonate with and therefore manipulate other waves.
## External / Free Magic
As the External Magic means to manipulate other waves, it means to add or take energy from them and so changing the world around. But as adding energy means that energy is required, the magicians give their own energy or lifeforce and can even kill themselves when overdoing it (see Gamemechanics for more information).
### Inject or Extract
Respectively adding and taking energy means to strengthen or weaken an amplitude of a wave. As most of the matter is in constant movement if not absolute cold, it can also be for example heatened up of cooled down.  
### Change
Mostly in their later years of learning how to use the resonance within themselves, magicians acquire the first knowledge of how to change the amplitude patterns in the waves to change matter into another kind of matter or a force into another force.
It takes a lot of energy and concentration to do this and is thus a highly respected kind of magic. 
### Create and Vary
The most dangerous and difficult variation of external magic is the one of creation, using the own energy to have a wave break through the space and materialize.
Also, creating a new matter through experimentation with the change of amplitude patterns into yet undiscovered ones can be a high risk for anyone trying to do this as the attributes of the new patterns and the results of the new creation can be disastrous. 
## Internal / Elemental Magic
Elemental magicians absorb elementals into their Astralwave to use their power in exchange of small portions of the magicians own energy.
After their absorption their power can be activated and then for one thing make the wielder immune to it, depending on how many elementals are taken and also be used as a weapon or to fusion with another elemental.
For another it can give the wielders the power of the elemental to empower the own body and later be used to empower and enlarge their auras to change their direct environment. 
### Elementals
Elementals are creatures of Myrmagir that are created randomly as strong amplitude patterns appearing around mostly something that has to do with the power inhabiting them.
## The Combination
The fusion of the two kinds of magic is called energetical magic and can be used to combine the power of both kinds of magic into one.
Using the low energy consumption and easy creation of forces via the power of elementals combined with the influence of free magic on other objects outside of the body brings endless possibilities to experiment and practically usages. 
## Storing Energy
Elementals can be stored in any object or even living beings, since the astralwave is in every connection of amplitudes on the matterwave even though in most not endlessly. But energy itself can just be stored in objects or taken away from other living beings.
For example on places for rites where magic is working on for Ions, special objects are used that take energy from around themselves to feed the elementals in them.
