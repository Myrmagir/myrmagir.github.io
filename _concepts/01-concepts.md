To explain what the nature of the fundamental systems in Myrmagir consists of, we divided our ideas into three essential concepts: [Waves](https://zujiry.github.io/concepts/waves/), [Magic](https://zujiry.github.io/concepts/magic/) and [Mythology](https://zujiry.github.io/concepts/mythology/).  
They are dependant on each other in various ways but are the basic knowledge to understand how Myrmagir works.

We suggest to read the articles in this order! Have fun!
