## Which are the foundation

The world of Myrmagir consists of threedimensional waves, of which amplitudes and properties the world exists how it is perceived by its inhabitants. These waves are very abstract so take your time to understand them.  
While the waves of Myrmagir can be described as waves, they are not always subject to the physical laws of our world.  

### Space
The Spacewave is the foundation of all the others, as it describes the space as a structure for all other waves to have an impact on. So to say it is the surface for the projection of the other waves but it can also be changed itself to create dimensions which can be anchored in very different places of the unchanged Spacewave.

### Matter
Directly working with the Spacewave, the Wave of matter has its amplitudes crashing through in the structure of it, being visible wherever it breaks the surface of it.
There are endless possibilities for the Matterwave to interact with the space through its patterns saved in the amplitudes and so there exist infinite particles created by it.
Special for the wave is also, that its amplitudes do not mostly interfere directly but are dependant on the forces that take effect on them and its various patterns.

### Force
As described in the Matter, the Force works as interference between amplitudes of the wave and so as any force there is, be it for example gravitation or electromagnetism.

### Astral
A wave that exists as the others in everything but varies strongly in its amplitude is called astral. While it is mostly strong in very complex beings and can even take the form of an aura, emerging from their bodies, it can also be like a little stream in stones.  
The Metabolism is the most complex thing found in the research of magic until now.

Through the Astralwave and the power of Resonance it is possible for a being to influence the waves and so the world around them.  
Adding to that, the astralwave stores a lot of things, such as memories of a being or object, which can be read via the wave itself.

### Time
Time in Myrmagir is relative as it is in our world and so it is more of a spacetimewave. Instead of a river always floating in the same speed, it can change of various places in space, being faster of slower relative to other parts of the world.

### Chaos
While there is order, there is also chaos in Myrmagir and nothing can be certain despite the wave is changed via magical means. But it is mostly impossible to foresee events as Chaos is completely random.

## And the powers changing them
The powers that take effect between or on the waves are just a few, but very important nonetheless.

### Resonance
Through the resonance, the waves can interact with each other and be influenced by beings with enough intelligence and magical might to do so.

### Timecurrent
As the Timewave is relative, the Timecurrent is not. It is the time, taken for the waves to interact with each other periodicaly.
