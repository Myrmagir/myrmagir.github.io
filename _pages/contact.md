## The Team Haiku

### Zujiry

Yo, I am Zujiry, kinda the organising hand behind Myrmagir.    
I tried through some Pen-&-Paper games and really liked the ideas and worlds I could peek and sometimes live in and as Sungod and a friend of us came to me with lots of ideas it became my dream too to build our own world, at last here in the internet!  

Since me being a coder guy, I am a coder guy here too building e.g. this website but mainly my dream is to write books, fantasy novels and such, and so I am mostly creating small worlds in our world! Have fun!

### DRcadian

Hallo everbody, my name is DRcadian and I am the medic of our group.   
I have started playing pen and paper role pay games (Pen-&-Paper RPGs) some years ago and the limitless possibilities have amazed me ever since. The combined imagination of your playgroup was the only thing constraining what you could do.  
As a result the idea of creating our very own Pen-&-Paper RPG world really hooked me. 

Me being a physician was probably the reason why I spend most of my time on developing the species which populate the solarsystem of Quinterra.  
It's honestly a blast doing this type of creative work and I hope you all enjoy our world.

### Jian Long

Hi! I am Jian Long and actually quite new to the world of Pen-&-Paper games.  
However combining my nonbiased perspective with the experience of the other members, I think we figured out pretty well to make a beginner friendly system that provides thrilling battles but focuses mainly on storytelling and interaction between the adventurers.  

My task in the team is to combine the ideas about the environment and to create spatiality/ambience, emphasizing on architecture, 
infrastructures and details which underline the given setting and atmosphere.
