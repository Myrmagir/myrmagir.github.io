### DRcadian

Hallo everbody, my name is DRcadian and I am the medic of our group. I have started playing pen and paper role pay games (p&p RPGs) some years ago and the limitless possibilities have amazed me ever since. The combined imagination of your playgroup was the only thing constraining what you could do. 
As a result the idea of creating our very own p&p RPG world really hooked me. 

Me being a physician was probably the reason why I spend most of my time on developing the species which populate the solarsystem of Quinterra. 
It's honestly a blast doing this type of creative work and I hope you all enjoy our world.

### Jian Long

Hi! I am Jian Long and actually quite new to the world of pen & paper games. 
  However combining my nonbiased perspective with the experience of the other members, I think we figured it out pretty well and made a beginner friendly system that provides thrilling battles but focuses mainly on storytelling and interaction between the adventurers.

My task in the team is to combine the ideas about the environment and to create spatiality/ambience, emphasizing on architecture, 
infrastructures and details which underline the given setting and atmosphere.
